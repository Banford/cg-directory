cg-directory
============

Directory UI widget.

*Usage*
See index.html for a demo.
Basically just construct it with some options, and then call init.

*Options*
inputSelector - A jQuery selector for the input that you wan't the selected item IDs to be written back to. (Required)
triggerText - The text for the trigger to launch the directory dialog. (Default 'Trigger')

*TODO*
There are a few things to do still with this plugin:

- Add search bar to the dialog.
- Add better paging info to be displayed, 'total items', 'Page x of x' etc.
- Make more things available as options, such as the ability to toggle search and paging info on and off.
